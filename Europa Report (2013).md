# Europa Report (2013)

### Criminally underrated

When it comes to space sci-fi, Interstellar will always be the best for me. But put that aside, Europa Report is THE best one I've seen in the past decade. I've always believed that a good story is the prerequisite for a good movie, and the story told in this movie is one of the most thrilling I've ever seen. I saw some people put this movie in creature feature lists, but it is not, on any account, a creature feature. So if that's what you were expecting then you'll definitely be disappointed. This is a story about human exploring the uncharted space in a very foreseeable and realistic feature. The whole story is told in a pseudo-documentary style, making it all the more mind-blowing. If you loved Interstellar and The Martian, you'll love this one as well!
