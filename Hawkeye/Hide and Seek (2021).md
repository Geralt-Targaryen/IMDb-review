# Hide and Seek (2021)
###### Episode 2, Season 1

### Come on it's not that bad

I have to say this show does seem a bit mediocre after we've seen Wanda manipulating reality and Loki travelling through the madness of multiverse, but Clint Barton is just an ordinary human to start with! (remember that scene in Age of Ultron where he and Natasha had to take a motorcycle while the others flew off?)

Yes we've seen hawkeye fight Thanos, but madness like that only becomes greatness because stuff like this paved a long way for those moments of climax. This is how marvel works. It's the ordinary aspects of these less powerful heroes that makes the appearance of gods and titans so exciting. If you keep that in mind, this show can be great fun to watch.

By the way, the costume of Kate Bishop does look a lot like Katniss Everdeen :)
