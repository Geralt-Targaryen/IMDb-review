### Sheldon learning to speak Chinese is hilarious!

I'm really not that interested in Penny and Leonard's relationship (just got tired of this kind of stuff after Friends), but for one who actually speaks Chinese, Sheldon's scenes in this episode made me laugh really hard. I really hope to see more scenes like these in the next seasons.
