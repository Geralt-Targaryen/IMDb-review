# The One Where Emma Cries (2002)

###### Episode 2, Season 9

### Had Enough

Joey is just unbelievable. Honestly, I never thought my first review on IMDb would be for a Friend episode, but it's just getting unbearably annoying. I don't understand why every season has to end in such a frustrating way (except for season 2). I certainly didn't watch a comedy to get myself pissed off. I really hated Rachel when she showed up at Ross's wedding, and back then I didn't think I would hate another character in this show more. I was wrong. This whole Joey's-proposal thing is just outrageous. And in this episode I really wished that Ross had hit Joey, really hard. And now that I come to think about it, I don't understand why anyone would want to be Joey's friends. He's incredibly stupid and has done nothing but causing troubles. The story line about Chandler's promotion and Emma's crying is good, though. I don't think I'll continue to watch this show and keep get disappointed.
