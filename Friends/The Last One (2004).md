# The Last One (2004)

###### Episode 17, Season 10

### Cliche, but not bad

At the end of The One with Rachel's Going Away Party, I cried. I thought I would cry even harder after this last one, but I can't. I watched it two times, and just don't feel like crying. Maybe it's because I'm somewhat 16 years late to watch this show, but it just starts to numb your feelings after all those toying with the audience's sentiments.

Anyway, I'm glad that Ross and Rachel worked things out in the end, although I was hoping to watch more about their lives after getting back together. And the final scene, with the empty room that we know so well, is very touching.

Also, it's nice to find out what happened to Chick Senior and Duck Senior. I always wondered why they just disappeared.

A decent ending to a show that ran for ten years.
