# The One Where Joey Speaks French (2004)

###### Episode 13, Season 10

### Finally

Ross and Rachel finally had some progress..... That's basically the only thing that kept me watching this show for the last three seasons. And for that reason, I give this episode a 8/10.

As for Joey, I just want to say I agree with Phoebe: he does seem retarded. But Joey's stupidity has long since stopped bothering me anymore. Just don't care that much about him.
