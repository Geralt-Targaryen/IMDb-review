###### Episode 6, Season 1

### Remarkable

This is the first episode in the series that truly blew my mind. Shadowed by hunger game (and game of thrones to be honest), it's really not that easy to get emotional when watching this kind of shows, because I kind of know when to expect betrayal, and when to expect sacrifice. But it's the bounding between the two girls, the ephemeral friendship between two untrusting strangers, that made this episode really stand out. Lee Yoo-mi really stole the scene.
